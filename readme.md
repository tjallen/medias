# WIP: porting vue.js medias app to react

setup:
- clone repo
- `npm i`
- get a themoviedb.org api key: https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api
- replace the X's in keys-example.json with your key
- rename keys-example.json to keys.json
- the app should now work, making api requests with your key

dev:
- `npm start` - run local development server
- `npm run prod` - minified production build (`npm run dist` and `npm run build` do the same thing)
